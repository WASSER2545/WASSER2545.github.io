## About Me



I'm currently a undergraduate student at China Agricultural University. 
I'm also very fortunate to closely work with Professor [Ju Fan](http://iir.ruc.edu.cn/~fanj) and [Chunwei Liu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/chunwei.html) as a research assistant.
Previously I worked as an intern in the search and recommendation algorithm team at Poizon.inc.
My current research interests include AI4DB, Data Mining.

## Research Interests

- **Recommender Systems (Recsys)**: My research in recommender systems primarily revolves around coarse ranking and fine ranking methodologies. I am particularly interested in developing effective coarse ranking algorithms that can quickly filter large item sets to identify promising candidates. Previously I worked as an Machine Learning Intern in Poizon community search team and Meituan Hotel & Travel recommandation team.
- **AI for Databases (AI4DB)**: I'm interested in exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and database management systems. I'm particularly focusing on building tools for real cloud database benchmarking and optimizing cloud database systems. Currently, I am closely collaborating with Professor [Chunwei Liu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/chunwei.html).
