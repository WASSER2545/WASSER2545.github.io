## About Me



Wang Zhengle, currently studying at China Agricultural University, in his junior year. He is currently a research assistant at the School of Information at Renmin University of China, under the supervision of Professor [Ju Fan](http://iir.ruc.edu.cn/~fanj)
Previously interned in the search and recommendation algorithm team at the Poizon Community.
My current research interests include AI4DB, Data Mining.

## Research Interests

- **Large Language Models**, especially on the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, planning, and execution, focusing on the controllability, interpretability, and efficiency of LLMs. Self-reflective, self-improving and self-evolving LLMs are also of interest.
- **AI Agents**, especially on [autonomous agents]((https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/)), multi-agent systems, and human-agent collaboration, focusing on the abilities of agents for reasoning, decision-making, and interaction.
- **Multimodel Learning**, especially on multimodal pretraining and multimodal reasoning, focusing on the fusion of vision and language.
- **Knowledge Computing**, especially on the colaboration of external knowledge and large language models, focusing on the knowledge reasoning and evolution.
